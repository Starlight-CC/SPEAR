# Comments
---
In SPEAR comments are defined by "//" and anything after will be commented out. 

EX:

    print("Hi") // Prints "Hi"

If you want to comment out multiple lines you would use a multi-line string.

EX:

    // [=[ 
    Big 
    Multiline
    Comment
    ]=]
    print("hi") // Code starts
